# this __init_.py file can be empty or contain package initialization code
# depending on the needs of the package.
# For now, it's left empty to indicate that 'common' is a package.
# You can add initialization code here if needed in the future.
# Now we will use the logger from common.logger in other modules.

from .logger import logger
# You can add more common utilities or imports here as needed.
